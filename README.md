## Introduction
Welcome to the LabVIEW-based Hemodynamic Monitoring System! This system is designed to provide accurate and real-time monitoring of hemodynamic parameters using LabVIEW software. It leverages the power of LabVIEW's graphical programming environment to analyze physiological signals and extract valuable information.

This README provides an overview of the system, its features, installation instructions, and guidelines for contributing to its development.

## Features
- Non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring using physiological signals.
- Real-time analysis of hemodynamic parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
- Intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy visualization of the monitored parameters.
- Configurable settings to adapt to different monitoring scenarios and sensor configurations.
- Integration with external devices and sensors for enhanced monitoring capabilities.
- Customizable data logging and reporting functionalities.

## Installation
To install the LabVIEW-based Hemodynamic Monitoring System, follow these steps:

1. Download and install LabVIEW from the official National Instruments website: [https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html)

2download the repository from GitHub.

3. Open the LabVIEW project file (`HemodynamicMonitoringSystem.lvproj`) in LabVIEW.

4. Review the project structure and dependencies.

5. Configure the system settings according to your requirements.

6. Build and deploy the LabVIEW application to your target platform.

7. Ensure that the required hardware, sensors, and data acquisition devices are properly connected and configured.

8. Launch the deployed LabVIEW application to start the hemodynamic monitoring system.

## Usage
Once the LabVIEW-based Hemodynamic Monitoring System is running, follow these steps to use it effectively:

1. Ensure that the required physiological sensors are properly connected and positioned on the subject.

2. Adjust the system settings, if necessary, to optimize monitoring accuracy and performance.

3. Start the monitoring process by clicking the appropriate button or control on the LabVIEW GUI.

4. The system will begin acquiring and analyzing physiological signals in real-time.

5. Monitor the displayed values, waveforms, and graphs to gain insights into the subject's hemodynamic status.

6. Customize the visualization and data logging options as per your requirements.

7. Stop the monitoring process by clicking the appropriate button or control on the LabVIEW GUI.

8. Analyze the recorded data and generate reports, if required, for further analysis or sharing with healthcare professionals.
